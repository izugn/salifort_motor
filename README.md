# Analysis of employee data and modeling (source: HR department at Salifort Motor Co.; Google Advanced Data Analytics course capstone project)

# Objective:
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company.
- Main problem: What are the major drivers of employee turnover? Whatâ€™s likely to make an employee leave the company?
- Goal: Data-driven suggestions to HR management, based on EDA findings and classification model results.

# Data Exploration (Initial EDA and data cleaning):
Data exploration, cleaning, data manipulation and modeling performed in Python programming language. 
Libraries used for data manipulation and visualization: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

Purpose of exploratory data analysis in general:
- Identify potential predictive features for modeling;
- Understand data quality issues (duplicates, outliers);
- Discover patterns and relationships that contribute feature engineering;
- Establish baseline understanding for interpreting model results later on.

# [Steps of EDA](notebooks/salifort_hr_eda.ipynb):
- The first step is to understand variables, standardize and clean the dataset: find missing- and redundant data, detect outliers.
Number of duplicated rows in the dataset: 3008. With several continuous variables in 10 columns, it seems unlikely that these data entries are legitimate, so I decided to frop them.
- Outliers: I create a helper fuction to calculate number of rows containing outliers in each column, then use 'tabulate' library for representing the results.
Column 'time_spend_company' showing the lenght of tenure is the only non-binary column shownig 824 outliers. This can be a concern later, when I build a logistic regression model, which is more sensitive to out;iers that others. I shall consider removing these outliers based on the type of model I apply.

Next, I analyze relationships between variables:
- Calculate department size and turnover rates (how many employees left / stayed).

Approach further segmentation and see
- mean satisfaction level by department;
- satisfaction levels by number of years spent at the company;
- relation between years at the company and turnover rates;
- mean monthly worktime by department;
- satisfaction levels vs. average monthly workhours;
- average monthly worktime vs. employees' evaluation score;
- turnover rates by the number of projects employees were involved in;
- relations between salary levels and years spent at the company;
- tunrover by monthly workhours and promotion;
- turnover by monthly workhours and work accident suffered.  
 
## Distributions:
Turnover rates varied by department between 11.93% - 18.8%.
- Highest: HR (18.8%), accounting (17.5%), technical (17.4%), support (17,1%) and sales (17%). 
- Lowest: Management (11.93%) and R&D (12.2%).

## Satisfaction levels accross departments:
- Across all departments, employees who stayed (blue) generally show higher median satisfaction levels (middle line in box) than those who left (orange);
- The satisfaction levels for those who left are consistently lower and show more variation (longer boxes) in most departments;
- At 'IT' and 'R&D' the distributions for those who stayed is more compact, suggesting more consistent satisfaction levels;
- The presence of outliers (dots beyond the whiskers) in some departments indicates individual cases that deviate significantly from the typical pattern. 'HR' boxplot shows, a more consistent and but lower satisfaction level for people who left. Those who stayed show more variable satisfaction levels, suggesting that employees might stay in HR even with varying levels of satisfaction. The department shows one of the larger gaps between median satisfaction of stayers versus leavers.

## Satisfaction and tenure:
- Years 2-4: High variation in satisfaction for those who stayed, while leavers show declining satisfaction;
- Year 4: Notable drop in satisfaction for leavers, with tight clustering around 0.1;
- Years 5-6: Interesting reversal - leavers show higher satisfaction (0.7-0.9) than stayers (0.2-0.7);
- Years 7+: No employees left the company, with satisfaction levels stabilizing around 0.5-0.8.

Highest employee count is at 3 years tenure (~5000 total), turnover peaks at years 3-5, with significant proportions leaving.
Sharp contrast after 7 years - zero turnover and smaller employee population, year 10 shows stable retention with about 100 employees.
- Critical retention period is years 3-5;
- After 7 years, turnover drops to zero, suggesting strong long-term retention;
- Mid-tenure (5-6 years) shows counterintuitive pattern where highly satisfied employees are leaving.

## Satisfaction, evaluation and average monthly working hours:
The three charts reveal concerning patterns about work hours and employee satisfaction.

- All departments show median monthly hours around 200;
- Employees who left (orange) consistently worked longer hours across departments;
- R&D shows highest median hours for leavers, followed by technical and accounting;
- Considerable overtime across all departments (standard is 160 hrs/month).

We can identify two distinct groups of leavers:
  1. Low hours (140-160) with moderate satisfaction (0.3-0.4)
  2. High hours (250-310) with very low satisfaction (0.1-0.2)

The red line at 160 hours shows standard monthly workload (calculated with 40 hours workweek, and 4 weeks vacation / year.)
- Most employees work above standard hours;
- High concentration of stayed employees (blue) between 0.6-0.8 satisfaction;
- We might assume correlation between excessive hours and low satisfaction leading to turnover.

## Insights about project workload and turnover:
- 7 projects: 100% turnover, extremely high hours (250-300);
- 6 projects: High turnover, working 225-275 hours;
- 2-3 projects: Lower hours (150-200) but still some turnover.

Project Distribution (Right Chart):
- Most employees handle 3-4 projects, these people seem to stay the most;
- Sharp increase in turnover for 5+ projects, no retention at 7 projects.

### Additional factors - work accident, promotion and salary levels:
#Analysis of promotion and work accident patterns:
- Very few employees (represented by 1.0 on y-axis) received promotions in past 5 years;
- Promoted employees generally stayed (blue dots);
- Most promoted employees worked standard hours (around 160/month);
- Almost no promotions for those working excessive hours (250-300);
- Only few employees who left were promoted.

#Low incidence of work accidents overall:
- Slight increase in accidents for those working longer hours (250-300);
- Most employees with accidents stayed (blue dots);
- Some correlation between overwork and accidents for those who left;
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f26b091d-288c-40a8-8376-8cbdf93e1a34)

# Salary distribution charts:
- Highest concentration of employees at 2-3 years, low and medium salaries dominate early years;
- High salaries are rare and decrease with tenure, sharp decline in all salary levels after year 3;
- Medium salary level dominates at 7+ years, more balanced distribution of high salaries here.

# Modeling Approach:
Describe the machine learning models you used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), including any preprocessing, class balancing, and hyperparameter tuning steps.
# Key Metrics:
Summarize the model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, F1-score). You can present them in tables or with confusion matrix images.
# Graphs:
Include important graphs like ROC curves, feature importance plots, and confusion matrices. These can be stored in the images/ folder and linked in the README.
# Business Recommendations:
Based on your model, summarize your findings and recommendations (e.g., which factors most influence employee turnover).
