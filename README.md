# Analysis of employee data and modeling (source: HR department at Salifort Motor Co.; Google Advanced Data Analytics course capstone project)

# Objective:
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. 
Main problem: What are the major drivers of employee turnover? Whatâ€™s likely to make an employee leave the company?
Goal: Data-driven suggestions to HR management, based EDA findings and modeling results.
