# Analysis of employee data and modeling (source: HR department at Salifort Motor Co.; Google Advanced Data Analytics course capstone project)

# Objective:
The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. 
Main problem: What are the major drivers of employee turnover? Whatâ€™s likely to make an employee leave the company?
Goal: Data-driven suggestions to HR management, based EDA findings and modeling results.

# Dataset Description:
Describe the dataset and any preprocessing steps.

# EDA Findings:
A brief summary of your Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights. Include a few key graphs (saved as images in the images/ folder).
# Modeling Approach:
Describe the machine learning models you used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), including any preprocessing, class balancing, and hyperparameter tuning steps.
# Key Metrics:
Summarize the model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, F1-score). You can present them in tables or with confusion matrix images.
# Graphs:
Include important graphs like ROC curves, feature importance plots, and confusion matrices. These can be stored in the images/ folder and linked in the README.
# Business Recommendations:
Based on your model, summarize your findings and recommendations (e.g., which factors most influence employee turnover).
# Future Work:
Suggest improvements or future analysis.
# Ethical Considerations:
Add any ethical concerns you encountered.
# Code:
Briefly explain where to find the key parts of your code (e.g., data preprocessing, modeling, evaluation).
